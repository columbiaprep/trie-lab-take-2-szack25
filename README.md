# Trie Lab: Name Searcher

## Overview
A trie is an efficient way to create a dictionary of words and to then check if they are valid words. It can also be used for predictive text and spellchecking purposes. 

## Objectives
Create a Trie consisting of the names of our CGPS students, as taken from last year's dataset. Implement the insert() and search() methods.

Then, write a method called predict() with the following characteristics:

### char[] predict(String n)
Parameters: A String of a name that is incomplete
Action: Finds the node in the Trie at which the String ends
Returns: The array of characters that are valid next characters.

## Grading Criteria
- Correctness of algorithms
- Commenting
- Code clarity and organization
